In this study, Feature extraction method based on CNN were used to extract important features and use it as an input for machine learning classification techniques to determine and predict COVID, NON-COVID, and Viral Pneumonia symptoms on the lungs. The proposed methods were using VGG-16 as a feature extractor model and two machine-learning algorithms is used K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results were very astonishing in terms of accuracy and F1 scores for the proposed models and it is reliable to make a good indication and prediction of the disease. The best result was using VGG-16 as extractor and SVM with an RBF kernel to achieve accuracy of 98% while KNN achieved 97%.
